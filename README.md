| **Project Management** | Task planning, coordination, timelines | **Janhavi Chavan** · **Ruthwik Dhaipulle** |

## Meetings & Communication

### Weekly Team Meeting (REQUIRED — #1 Priority)

| | |
|---|---|
| **When** | Every **Tuesday** — **1:00 PM PST**|
| **Who** | Both Data Engineering and Data Analytics |
| **Where** | Zoom (link shared in WhatsApp group) |

This is the most important meeting. This is where you give updates, ask questions, get unblocked, and sync with the team. **Save your questions for this meeting** — mid-week, people get busy and responses take time.

**If you miss 4 team meetings in a row, you will be removed from the group.**

### Daily Scrum (Org-Wide)

| | |
|---|---|
| **When** | Every weekday at **10:00 AM PST** |
| **Who** | All Saayam tech volunteers |
| **Led by** | **Rao Bhethanabotla** |

This is an org-wide standup. Useful for getting context on what other teams are doing and for getting help from Rao directly. **Mandatory if you have an offer letter.** If you cannot attend, send your status to the WhatsApp group.

### WhatsApp

One shared WhatsApp group for both Data Engineering and Data Analytics. This is the primary communication channel. Introduce yourself when you join: name, qualifications, school, location, interests.

**Communication etiquette:** Our volunteers are across time zones and countries. Never call someone directly without checking availability via WhatsApp first.

**Escalation chain:** Team WhatsApp group → Software WhatsApp group (if no response in 24 hrs) → Rao Bhethanabotla (408-390-1725).

## What the Data Engineering Team Does

We build the **data pipeline** that powers Saayam's intelligent features — scraping, cleaning, aggregating, and serving data so the AI team and frontend can use it.

For current tasks and roadmap, see **[TASK_TRACKER.md](data-engineering/TASK_TRACKER.md)**.

For how to work in this codebase (setup, repo structure, code standards, where to put files), see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](data-engineering/CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

For deep technical context, architecture, and leadership handoff info, see **[KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER.md](data-engineering/KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER.md)**.

## Getting Started

### 1. Get Access

- Fill out the **[Access Hub Form](https://forms.gle/Mg8J3fSvA7AAHVxq5)** to get added to GitHub and WhatsApp.
- Make sure your GitHub profile has your **real name and profile picture** — required for task assignments.

### 2. Set Up the Repo

Follow the setup instructions in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](data-engineering/CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

### 3. Explore the Product

Go to [test-saayam.netlify.app](https://test-saayam.netlify.app/). Submit a help request. Understand the categories.

### 4. Complete the Beginner Task

There is a **beginner task** you must complete before being assigned real work. Check the issues tab for the issue labeled `good first issue` or ask in the team WhatsApp group for the current beginner task.

### 5. Attend the Tuesday Team Meeting

Show up, introduce yourself, and you'll be guided from there.

## Expectations

### Accountability

We'll be real with you: **97% of volunteers who join don't work consistently.** We're not trying to be harsh — we just need reliability. Here are the rules:

- **If you are assigned a task and have no updates, no heads up, and no valid reason — you will be removed from the task.**
- **If you miss 4 weekly team meetings in a row — you will be removed from the group.**
- If life gets in the way, just tell us. Communication is everything. Nobody will be upset if you need time off — what causes problems is silence.

### Timesheets

Log your hours weekly in the **Google Sheet** shared in the WhatsApp Organization group every Monday:
- Your name, hours worked, team name, GitHub issue URL, brief task description.
- **Deadline:** Tuesday EOD. Window closes **Wednesday 12:00 AM EST**. No late submissions.

### Pair Programming

Most tasks are assigned to 2+ people. Coordinate with your pair. If you need to step away, tell your pair and your team lead.
